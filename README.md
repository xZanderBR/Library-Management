# Library-Management
Library Management project written in C++ and run through CLI to imagine how a library might manage collections and patrons. Features many different item types such as books, audio, video, etc. and a fully-functional waitlist.

## Input and Output
By design, the program must take a library collection file specified as `-L` and a library patron file specified as `-P`. Example files are provided in the `src` directory to be ran with the program. If any of these parameters aren't specified, then the program will exit.

Once the library is loaded, the user is greeted with multiple options to manage items and print reports.
